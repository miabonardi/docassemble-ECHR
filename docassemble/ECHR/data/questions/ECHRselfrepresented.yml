  **Individual Application to the European Court of Human Rights**
  
  This form is a formal legal document and may affect your rights and obligations. 
  
  This form is intended to be used by self-represented individual applicants.
  
  Although you do not need to be represented by a lawyer in the first stages of the proceedings, you will need a lawyer once your application has been notified to the Government. The great majority of applications are, however, declared inadmissible without being notified to the government. 
  
  After you submit your application, you may apply for legal aid. 
  
  Make sure you fill in all the fields applicable to your situation and provide all relevant documents.
  
  If a field is required in this form, it is required under [Rule 47](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Rule_47_ENG.pdf) of the Court, which sets out the information and documents that must be provided.
  
  Tap the {green words} in any screen for a definition or more information.
  
  For more information on the application process, visit [the Court's website](https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=applicants&c=#n1365511805813_pointer).

subquestion: |
  **Applying to the Court**
  
  You do not need to be a national of [one of the States bound by the Convention](https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/005/signatures). The violation you are complaining of must simply have been committed by one of those States against a person within its {jurisdiction}.
  
  Your application must relate to one or more of the rights set out in the [European Convention on Human Rights](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf) and Protocols.
    
  Your complaints must be based on solid evidence. You have to substantiate your claims by telling your story clearly and supporting it with documents, decisions, medical reports, witness statements, and other material.
  
  The Court is not empowered to overrule national decisions or annul national laws.
  
  As a general rule, any information contained in the application form and documents which are lodged with the Registry, including information about the applicant or third parties, will be **accessible to the public**. Moreover, such information may be accessible on the Internet via the Court’s HUDOC database if the Court includes it in a statement of facts prepared for the notification of the case to the respondent Government, a decision on admissibility or striking out, or a judgment. Accordingly, you should only provide such details concerning your private life or that of third parties as are essential for an understanding of the case.
  
  In addition, if you do not wish your identity to be disclosed to the public, you must say so and set out the reasons for such a departure from the normal rule of public access to information in the proceedings. The Court may authorise anonymity in exceptional and duly justified cases.

  You said the final decision at the domestic level was taken before **${ format_date( current_datetime() - date_interval(months=6) ) }**. That was more than 6 months ago.
  
  Under [Rule 47](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Rule_47_ENG.pdf), the date your application is postmarked cannot be more than 6 months after the final decision at the domestic level was taken. For this calculation, we assume you plan to mail your application today, **${ current_datetime() }**. 
  
  The application form, together with all the required information and documents, must be dispatched to the Court **on or before the final day of the six month period**.
  
  There is no guarantee that if an application form is rejected as incomplete there will be enough time for you to submit a new application before the six-month time-limit. For that reason, you should take care to submit a complete application form together with all the necessary supporting documents.
    
  You can still proceed with your application, but it may be deemed inadmissable.
